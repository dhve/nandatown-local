"""The pinned stage evaluator.

Each stage is a separate claim with a separate failure boundary.
Acceptance, claiming, receipt, processing, response, and semantic
correctness are always judged separately; an HTTP success response never
becomes proof that the agent understood or completed the task. Missing
evidence stays missing: it is reported as Not enough evidence, never
inferred.
