"""Campaigns: reliability claims need repetition, not one lucky run.

One run resolving to one verdict certifies luck when the actor is
nondeterministic. A campaign precommits its plan (name, trial count,
seeds, evaluator, publication policy) before the first trial, runs every
trial, and reports the full distribution. Every pass, failure, error,
and missing verdict stays in the record.
